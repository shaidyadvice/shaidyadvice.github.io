I started playing bestball seriously in 2023. To be honest, it started as a way to shift some tax liability because I'd had an amazing DFS year. Bestball seemed like a way I could pay entry fees in one tax year, but earn winnings in the following year. 

However, Bestball quickly became just as interesting to me as DFS. Part of its charm is that it's a less-developed space than DFS, so I think there's still more edge out there for smart players.

    <h2>The LegUp Sidekick</h2>
    <p>I joined the LegUp team in 2024 to co-develop the Sidekick, a dynamic rankings tool for Bestball. The Sidekick can be purchased on its own, or as an add-on for existing LegUp users. <a href="https://www.legendaryupside.com/sidekick/">Find the Sidekick here</a>.</p>
