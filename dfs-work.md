I’m one of the most successful current Daily Fantasy Sports (DFS) players in the world. I first got introduced to DFS in 2019, seeing it as a fun puzzle to solve. I like that it’s always changing as new players enter the space, new tools become available, and new strategies emerge. 

I’ve become known for a <a href="#portfolio-management">portfolio and risk-management</a> focused approach to DFS. The best way to help other players adopt this approach is to offer access to my portfolio optimization algorithm. This is the algorithm that I use to enter a diverse portfolio of lineups while still achieving a high ROI across sports. (Why should you trust me? Check out [About Me](/about-me/) for some of my accomplishments.) 

Below you’ll find a list of the tools I’m currently partnered with to prove access to my portfolio optimization algorithm.

    <h2 id="portfolio-optimization">What is portfolio optimization?</h2>
    <p>I use a "Three Ps" framework to break down the DFS process where portfolio optimization is the final step:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Projections:</b> Choose player and field projections/distributions</li>
      <li><b>Pool of Lineups:</b> Generate a pool of strong lineup candidates from those projections</li>
      <li><b>Portfolio:</b> Select a diverse set of lineups from your pool using portfolio optimization</li>
    </ul>
    <p>A portfolio optimization algorithm diversifies your lineups while sacrificing the minimum amount expected value. This approach keeps DFS players profitable while reducing their risk of ruin. My partnership with sites you already trust for projections and lineup pools allows you to add the same state-of-the-art portfolio algorithm used in my DFS process to yours.</p>
