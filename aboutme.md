## My story
I'm a former particle physicist turned DFS pro. In addition to my successful career as a DFS and Bestball player, I enjoy building tools that help other players level up their game. I've worked on [The LegUp Sidekick](https://www.legendaryupside.com/sidekick/) and [SaberSim](https://www.sabersim.com/). See [My Work] for more. 

Some of my DFS and Bestball accomplishments include: 
- Two-time Milli-Maker winner
- 2024 Fantasy Baseball World Championship winner ($1M prize)
- 2024 Fantasy Foodball World Championship runner-up ($1M prize for second place)
- 2023 Best Ball Mania third-place finisher ($300K prize for third place)

## About the name
I get asked a lot where the name ShaidyAdvice comes from. I've used variants on Shaidar and Shaidy as a handle since about 2000, after [everyone's favorite Fade from Wheel of Time](https://wot.fandom.com/wiki/Shaidar_Haran). I became ShaidyAdvice during my first foray into online content creation: A series of tutorial videos for running successful raids in World of Warcraft.
